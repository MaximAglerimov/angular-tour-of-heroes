# AngularTourOfHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Main idea

There are a few goals I want to achieve within this pet-project:

- Configure a **workspace**;
- Configure an **ESLint** and **pre-commit check**;
- Refactor an entire codebase
  - to try to achieve **standalone components**
  - and **HTML5** layout;
- Practice in **e2e tests**;

## To serve this

- Run `npm install`;
- Run `ng serve --open`;
